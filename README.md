## Model Viewer

Implement MMD models using Babylon.js and babylon-mmd as a hobby project.
(Not finished)

### https://fuhayho.github.io/model-viewer-demo/docs/

Don's ask me why need /docs. Ask github. They really slow.

## Build Settings

- Typescript
- Webpack (only resolve html template, typescript, and static files)
- Babylon.js (with es6 module tree shaking applied)
- eslint (Babyon.js coding style)

## Details

- Run it with `npm i` & `npm start`
- It will do the eslint fix for you on save
- All code is written in sceneBuilder.ts
